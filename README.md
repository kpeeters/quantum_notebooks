# Quantum Mechanics notebooks

This is a collection of Jupyter and Cadabra notebooks to illustrate
quantum mechanics. Work in progress. You can open them in Google Colab
by simply clicking the links below, or you can clone this repository
and open the files in a local Jupyter installation.

## Contents:

* **Sum of energy eigenstates**  
  Show the time-evolution of a sum of two energy eigenstates for a 
  particle in a box.

* **One-dimensional free particle**
  Shows the time-evolution of a free Guassian wave packet.

* **Coherent state of the harmonic oscillator**
  Shows the time-evolution of a coherent state of the 
  harmonic oscillator, and its particle-like behaviour.
  https://colab.research.google.com/github/kpeeters/quantum_notebooks/blob/master/coherent.ipynb
  
* **Tunneling**  
  Shows animations of a moving Guassian wave packet which tunnels
  through a finite-size barrier.
